### Hey hey! üëã
I'm Edmond (he/they), a 4th year Computer Science major at UCLA. 
- üî¨ Currently interning at [Deep 6 AI](https://deep6.ai/). Excited to be working on software used by health systems across the nation to find better matching patients for clinical trials. Did you know that [developing a drug from end to end can regularly exceed $2 billion](https://www.genengnews.com/gen-edge/the-unbearable-cost-of-drug-development-deloitte-report-shows-15-jump-in-rd-to-2-3-billion/#:~:text=A%20pair%20of%20recently%2Dreleased,billion%20per%20therapy%20on%20average.)? Performing effective clinical trials efficiently and early on can save lots of money and time! 
- üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è I do research with the UCLA Department of Medicine under [Dr. Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/li-zhou-289362b5/?trk=public_profile_browsemap_mini-profile_title) and [Dr. Korf](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/richard-korf/). My focus is using technology to improve medical reconciliation, which is the process of creating the most accurate list possible of all medications a patient is taking. We've recently secured a grant for our project and are eager to start clinical trials soon!
- ü§ñ I was the Projects Director for [UCLA ACM AI](https://www.uclaacm.com/) [@uclaacm](https://github.com/uclaacm). I build deep learning models to tackle challenges on Kaggle. Then, I teach other UCLA students how to understand the theory behind those models and implement them in Pytorch. I built and taught a track that uses sentiment analysis to determine if a [Quora question is sincere or not](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data). I've previously taught and developed for the [Cassava Leaf Disease Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification) as well as the [Humpback Whale Identification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification).
- üì± Last summer, I interned with Samsung Semiconductors at the [Meta Vision Lab](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/us-r-and-d-labs/samsung-advanced-institute-of-technology/). I developed a full-stack mobile app using React-Native and Flask that provided a mobile platform for infectious disease biosensing (imagine being able to take a Covid test and get results using just your phone!). I also wrote image processing scripts in Matlab and Python to improve transparent object detection with convolutional neural networks.
- üõ†Ô∏è Last year, I also interned part-time with Siemens Digital Industries Software where I wrote a command line tool in batch that saves engineers 30 minutes each time they ran QA tests for [NX Cad's JT Inspector Tool](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/updates-in-jt-inspector). I also improved the integration of third party libraries in NX Cad's C++ source code to increase security and efficiency.
