### Hey hey! 👋
I'm Edmond, a third year Computer Science major at UCLA. 
- 👨‍⚕️ I do research with the UCLA Department of Medicine under [Dr. Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/li-zhou-289362b5/?trk=public_profile_browsemap_mini-profile_title) and [Dr. Korf](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/richard-korf/). My focus is using technology to improve medical reconciliation, which is the process of creating the most accurate list possible of all medications a patient is taking.
- 🤖 I am the projects director for [UCLA ACM AI](https://www.uclaacm.com/) [@uclaacm](https://github.com/uclaacm). I build deep learning models to tackle challenges on Kaggle. Then, I teach other UCLA students how to understand the theory behind those models and implement them in Pytorch! I am currently leading a track that uses NLP sentiment analysis to determine if a [Quora question is sincere or not](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data). I've previously taught and developed for the [Cassava Leaf Disease Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification) as well as the [Humpback Whale Identification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification).
- 🏳️‍🌈 I am the JEDI Director (justice, equity, diversity, inclusion) for UCLA ACM. My job is to promote accessibility and inclusivity in ACM as well as the broader computer science community at UCLA. I am currently collaborating with ACM's Dev Team to create the Anti-Resume, an online platform to highlight the failures and successes that normally don't show up on a resume.
- 📱 Last summer, I interned with Samsung Semiconductors at the [Meta Vision Lab](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/us-r-and-d-labs/meta-vision/). I developed a full-stack mobile app using React-Native and Flask that provided a mobile platform for infectious disease biosensing (imagine being able to take a Covid test and get results using just your phone!). I also wrote image processing scripts in Matlab and Python to improve transparent object detection with convolutional neural networks.
- 🛠️ Last year, I also interned part-time with Siemens Digital Industries Software where I wrote a command line tool in batch that saves engineers 30 minutes each time they ran QA tests for [NX Cad's JT Inspector Tool](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/updates-in-jt-inspector). I also improved the integration of third party libraries in NX Cad's C++ source code to increase security and efficiency. 
- 📫 I am currently searching for an internship for Summer 2023! If my skillset and background are a good match, reach out at edmond.yixiu.wen@gmail.com. 
- 😄 I play badminton in my free time. I am currently reading [The Song of Achilles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13623848-the-song-of-achilles).
